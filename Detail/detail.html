    <h2>Pumpkin Sculpture</h2>

    <p>
      I took a class where we used clay to create different sculptures, and this
      is my favourite one. By forming long strings and putting them on top of
      each other I got the bowl-like shape, and after that I used clay to form
      and sculpt my shape. If you look closely, you kan se the clays on the
      inside of the pumpkin.
